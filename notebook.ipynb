What is the average fuel consumption for regular gasoline (Fuel Type = X), premium gasoline (Z), ethanol (E), and diesel (D)?  \n3. What is the correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?\n4. Which vehicle class has lower average CO2 emissions, 'SUV - SMALL' or 'MID-SIZE'? \n5. What are the average CO2 emissions for all vehicles? For vehicles with an engine size of 2.0 liters or smaller?\n6.
